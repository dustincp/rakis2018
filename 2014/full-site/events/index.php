    	<em>You awaken groggily, your clouded vision focuses upon the bars of what appears to be your cell. You see movement in the darkness beyond, and hear the clanging of weapons against one another. More movement, more clanging. You can vaguely make out the shape of other people running past. You call out, and one of the figures moves toward you. His muscles strain as he rips the bar off of your cell. “Come on,” he says, “They’ve secured the armoury. It’s time for us to leave.”</em></p>

        <p>Two teams: Guards, and Prisoners. The game begins with the guards in their towers, and the prisoners in the armories. The prisoners control the two armories and the cell block area and the guards control the two towers and the gate. Each team has three keys to their respective areas, which are held by players at the start of the game. The first team to obtain the three keys to the other team’s structures wins.</p>
		<p>Prisoners may respawn in the cell block, and Guards in the gate. Players may also heal a wound after 30 seconds by staying within their respective armoury/tower. Death counts are 60 seconds; begin counting immediately upon dying, but you must be in your spawn point to come back alive.</p></div></li>

    	<em>“There it is,” Garthok quietly whispers, motioning you all to the edge of the precipice,”Azura’s Star, there for the taking.” Below, you can see the caravan slowly rolling along the mountain paths. “I would have expected more guards,” you growl. Garthok hushes you, and says “We can’t be the only ones who know about this. Jitheesh was willing to sell the information to anyone with money and a pulse. We need to get in there quick, get the star, and get the hell out of here.” Testing your dagger’s edge against your thumb, you grumble “Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s do this.”</em></p>

        <div class="hide"><p>Two teams of bandits are attacking a caravan carrying rare Daedric artifacts.

    	<em>As you look out across the vast valley below, the labyrinth sprawls out ahead of you and your companions. Somewhere in that maze is the fabled Elder Scroll. Through the haze, you can vaguely see in the distance other groups of adventurers, all coalescing at the edges of the maze. Grimly, you wipe the blood from your axe. This Elder Scroll, this artifact that exists outside of time, had better be worth the money you’re being paid to <br />obtain it.</em></p>

        <div class="hide"><p>Multiple 5-7 person teams. Teams will be fighting one another for the Elder Scroll. 45 minute timed full class battle game.

You may not interact with the Elder Scroll if you are incapable of interacting with game items (e.g. Out of Game, Insubstantial, Frozen, etc.). Upon death, you must exit the maze and enter the maze again from a different point in order to respawn.</p></div></li>

	<li><p><span class="callout">10:00 am - Siege of Solitude - Full Class Battle</span><br />
    	<em>It all comes down to this. The Stormcloaks have managed to sack every city in Skyrim; Solitude is the only one that still stands. Their siege engines stand tall in the distance as they roll inevitably toward the walls. Great barrels of firey pitch light the skyline, making the ominous towers climb further into the sky. The Captain clears his throat, and tried to sound brave as he rallies the troops to the city’s defense. “We can end this here!” he yells, “destroy the towers, and give no quarter to the invaders! Solitude shall stand, and the Stormcloaks shall fall this night!” Half-hearted cheers raise from the gathered mass of soldiers. Fearfully, you grip the hilt of your sword and take your position to repel the enemy.</em></p>

        <div class="hide"><p>The Imperials and the Stormcloaks epic battle is coming to a head. The goal of the Stormcloaks is to raze the city of Solitude to the ground. The goal of the Imperials is to destroy the siege engines of the Stormcloaks. Each team will have 5 bases (“towers” or “Siege Engines”) that they need to protect while also destroying the other teams bases. In order to destroy a base, it must be lit on fire, which is done by placing a “torch” (ring) around the spire on the base. Every minute, a reeve will take stock, and determine if any of the bases are lit. If they are, it loses one hit point. Once 5 hit points are destroyed, the tower is considered razed.</p></div></li>
