<h1>Role Play Tavern</h1>
<div class="pq">
<p>Welcome to the Weeping Unicorn Bar & Grill! It is so good to see you, and I’m glad you made it out of prison. Yes, I know you were wrongfully imprisoned. You and everyone else. Now that you are free, it’s time for you to earn your keep.</p>
<p>My name is Daenen Trelmayn Half-Elven, and I have a job for you. Tamriel is in trouble, but people don’t realize it yet. The Empire is being subverted, slowly but surely. I have my fears, but I need you to gather evidence first. You will need to gain the trust of the five Guilds. Yes, your friends can help you. Which Guilds? Wow, you have been in jail a long time. The Warrior’s Guild will need strong fighters to protect the realm. The Mage’s Guild has need of apprentices to help in the laboratories. The Thieves guild needs help gathering funds and spreading the wealth around. The Undaunted search for secrets in hidden tunnels and ancient passages. And the Dark Brotherhood may need your help eliminating targets who are working for the Enemy.</p>
<p>Who is this Enemy? I dare not speak his name, for to utter it calls His attention. Go now! Search for ways to help the Empire. If you have further questions, I can be found at the Weeping Unicorn.</p>
</div>
<p>At this Elder Scrolls Rakis, the Role Play tavern will play an integral part of the event. Players can come here to get quests, to sign up to help out around the event, or to simply hang out and meet new people. There will always be something for you to do, from exploring the lands of Tamriel to protecting traveling Merchants to investigating rumors of a Dragon or a Moon Sugar farm. Enjoy your time at Rakis and be sure to visit the Weeping Unicorn Bar & Grill!</p>

<h1>Quest Rules</h1>
<p>Quests will be run entirely using the latest release of the Amtgard v8 rules, with monsters adapted from the Dor Un Avathar X. <br />There are two types of quests: </p>
<p>
    <div style="width:48%;margin-right:4%;float:left;">
        <span class="title">Scheduled Quests</span>
        <p>These are the story quests which advance the plot. These quests will require a 5 person team to accomplish their objective. Some of the quests will pit players against each other. All participating teams will receive an award, with a bonus for the winning team.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <span class="title">Repeatable Quests</span>
        <p>Some quests will have the players assist the various factions in running Rakis. They may be called upon to enhance the experience for all with a little roleplay or bring supplies to those in need. There is also the ever famous Assassin's Game.</p>
    </div>
</p>
<h1>Magic Items</h1>
<p>Magic items for use during the quests are only obtainable through the Role Play Tavern. Anvils, used to purchase magic items, will be rewarded for completing quests and playing monsters. Anvils can also be purchased at a low cost by those that would like to support the Role Play Tavern.</p> 
<p>Some magic items will require the players to be in good standing with a specific faction before they become available for purchase:</p>
