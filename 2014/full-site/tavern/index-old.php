<h1>Role Play Tavern</h1>
<div class="pq">
<p>Welcome to the Weeping Unicorn Bar & Grill! It is so good to see you, and I’m glad you made it out of prison. Yes, I know you were wrongfully imprisoned. You and everyone else. Now that you are free, it’s time for you to earn your keep.</p>
<p>My name is Daenen Trelmayn Half-Elven, and I have a job for you. Tamriel is in trouble, but people don’t realize it yet. The Empire is being subverted, slowly but surely. I have my fears, but I need you to gather evidence first. You will need to gain the trust of the five Guilds. Yes, your friends can help you. Which Guilds? Wow, you have been in jail a long time. The Warrior’s Guild will need strong fighters to protect the realm. The Mage’s Guild has need of apprentices to help in the laboratories. The Thieves guild needs help gathering funds and spreading the wealth around. The Undaunted search for secrets in hidden tunnels and ancient passages. And the Dark Brotherhood may need your help eliminating targets who are working for the Enemy.</p>
<p>Who is this Enemy? I dare not speak his name, for to utter it calls His attention. Go now! Search for ways to help the Empire. If you have further questions, I can be found at the Weeping Unicorn.</p>

There will always be something for you to do, from exploring the lands of Tamriel to protecting traveling Merchants to investigating rumors of a Dragon or a Moon Sugar farm. Enjoy your time at Rakis and be sure to visit the Weeping Unicorn Bar & Grill!</p>
