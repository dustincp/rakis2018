    <h1>Adventurers, Welcome to Rakis</h1>
    <p>Rakis is Colorado's premier Amtgard event hosted each year by the Empire of the Iron Mountains. This year we'll be incorporating elements from the Elder Scrolls games, including the recently released Elder Scrolls Online. Rakis will be held <br /><span class="callout">June 11th - 15th in Byers, CO</span>.</p>
    <p>During the day you'll be able to play in creative battlegames, eat delicious feasts, show off your A&S skills in our yearly Best of the Best tournament, and armchair referee Jugging to your heart's content. Enjoy some great company and festivities once the sun goes down, and maybe undertake a clandestine mission from the Dark Brotherhood while you're at it.</p>

	<h1>Get Sweet Loot</h1>
    <p>Your gate favor will serve as a record of your accomplishments during the event. You'll collect achievement stamps as you assist the factions with their quests and participate in other activites that Rakis has to offer.</p>
	<p>We will also have a limited run of hoodies in various sizes available for purchase at Rakis this year. This year's high quality hoodies have a design that was created to showcase our reign theme and still have a strong Amtgard connection. You can acquire one at gate for the very reasonable price of $30 (or $35 for a zippered hoodie).</p>
    <p>We've also been approached by a few vendors. It is very likely there will be weapons, shields, garb, and other interesting items available to purchase.</p>
